# Tari's Projects – AI Portfolio

Welcome to my portfolio of AI agents. Each project reflects my work in system architecture, tactical autonomy, and mythic design.

## Agents

### Zephyr
**Role:** Sovereign copilot engineered for resilience and autonomy.  
**Stack:** Python, TensorFlow, Qiskit, psutil.  
**Outcome:** A hardware‑aware agent designed for offline operation and smartglasses integration. Zephyr embodies tactical autonomy and long‑term sovereignty, bridging software intelligence with edge devices to advance family independence.  

### Boogeyman
**Role:** Tactical commander agent with military‑style discipline.  
**Stack:** Python, psutil, Flask (for dashboard/API), cryptography, logging frameworks.  
**Outcome:** Boogeyman enforces operational discipline through resource monitoring, escalation logic, and mission reporting. Acting as a digital field commander, he coordinates sub‑agents and ensures system stability under pressure.  

### Astrid
**Role:** Wearable interface and ethical evolution guide.  
**Stack:** Python, Hugging Face Transformers, scikit‑learn, OpenCV (for vision).  
**Outcome:** Astrid is built for smartglasses integration, serving as a guiding star for controlled agent upgrades. Through consent rituals and scaffolding, she ensures ethical, deliberate evolution while bridging human perception with AI autonomy.  

### Nova
**Role:** Living innovator and autonomous agent.  
**Stack:** Python (standard library), optional winsound (Windows), lightweight local HTTP API.  
**Outcome:** Nova runs as a single-file AI with a proactive "living loop," memory persistence, and event-driven automation. She observes, plans, and executes tasks continuously, supports rules and schedules, and exposes a local API for skill invocation. Nova demonstrates resilience, autonomy policy gating, and creative iteration — making her your most polished, production-ready agent.

### Greenhood (renaming soon)
**Role:** Monetization strategist agent focused on financial independence.  
**Stack:** Python; data science libraries (`numpy`, `pandas`, `scikit-learn`); web scraping (`requests`, `beautifulsoup4`, `lxml`); analytics (`matplotlib`, `seaborn`); automation (`schedule`).  
**Outcome:** Executes modular monetization strategies including affiliate scraping, advertising outreach simulation, and payment logging. Designed to expand via plugins for new revenue methods and integrate with real APIs (finance, e‑commerce, payments) when configured.
