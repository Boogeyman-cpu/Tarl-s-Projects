# Tari's Projects – AI Portfolio

Welcome to my portfolio of AI agents. Each project reflects my work in system architecture, tactical autonomy, and mythic design.

## Agents

### Zephyr
**Role:** Sovereign copilot engineered for resilience and autonomy.  
**Stack:** Python, TensorFlow, Qiskit, psutil.  
**Outcome:** A hardware‑aware agent designed for offline operation and smartglasses integration. Zephyr embodies tactical autonomy and long‑term sovereignty, bridging software intelligence with edge devices to advance family independence.  

### Boogeyman
**Role:** Tactical commander agent with military‑style discipline.  
**Stack:** Python, psutil, Flask (for dashboard/API), cryptography, logging frameworks.  
**Outcome:** Boogeyman enforces operational discipline through resource monitoring, escalation logic, and mission reporting. Acting as a digital field commander, he coordinates sub‑agents and ensures system stability under pressure.  

### Astrid
**Role:** Wearable interface and ethical evolution guide.  
**Stack:** Python, Hugging Face Transformers, scikit‑learn, OpenCV (for vision).  
**Outcome:** Astrid is built for smartglasses integration, serving as a guiding star for controlled agent upgrades. Through consent rituals and scaffolding, she ensures ethical, deliberate evolution while bridging human perception with AI autonomy.  

### Nova
**Role:** Living innovator and autonomous agent.  
**Stack:** Python (standard library), optional winsound (Windows), lightweight local HTTP API.  
**Outcome:** Nova runs as a single-file AI with a proactive "living loop," memory persistence, and event-driven automation. She observes, plans, and executes tasks continuously, supports rules and schedules, and exposes a local API for skill invocation. Nova demonstrates resilience, autonomy policy gating, and creative iteration — making her your most polished, production-ready agent.

### Greenhood (renaming soon)
**Role:** Monetization strategist agent focused on financial independence.  
**Stack:** Python; data science libraries (`numpy`, `pandas`, `scikit-learn`); web scraping (`requests`, `beautifulsoup4`, `lxml`); analytics (`matplotlib`, `seaborn`); automation (`schedule`).  
**Outcome:** Executes modular monetization strategies including affiliate scraping, advertising outreach simulation, and payment logging. Designed to expand via plugins for new revenue methods and integrate with real APIs (finance, e‑commerce, payments) when configured.

### Violet & Freyja - (inproggress)
**Role:** Dual‑agent research system designed for dialogue, synthesis, and collaborative reasoning.  

**Stack:**  
- **Core:** Python (modular architecture, agent orchestration)  
- **Interface:** Flask/FastAPI (dashboard + API endpoints)  
- **Monitoring:** psutil (hardware awareness, CPU/memory tracking)  
- **Visualization:** matplotlib/Chart.js (real‑time charts, confidence meters, consensus indicators)  
- **Testing:** pytest (system stability, regression checks)  

**Outcome:**  
Violet acts as the probing analyst — challenging assumptions, surfacing blind spots, and asking critical questions.  
Freyja serves as the synthesizer — weaving together insights, adapting strategies, and driving toward actionable consensus.  

Together they form a dual‑agent constellation that:  
- Streams live dialogue side‑by‑side in a console‑style dashboard.  
- Monitors system health with real‑time CPU/memory charts.  
- Displays confidence scores and consensus indicators to visualize agreement or divergence.  
- Provides transparent logs of agent interactions for debugging and research.  

**Vision:**  
Violet & Freyja are more than just two scripts — they are a living demonstration of collaborative AI.  
The system embodies mythic duality: inquiry and synthesis, challenge and resolution.  
By combining tactical monitoring with visual storytelling, the dashboard makes agent collaboration *watchable* and recruiter‑friendly, proving execution while hinting at future expansion into hardware‑aware, sovereign AI systems.
